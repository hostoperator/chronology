This archive is the complete and on going works of Host Operator. 

WHO?
Host/Operator is a sound performance project that uses intuitive sound performance to address ideas of performative state; the mental and physical space we occupy when engaging with the creative process. To date Host/Operator have performed, recorded and released over 24 hours of audio material across 50 audio releases.

WHAT?
The performative state is singular moment that you inhabit when performing that is abstracted from time and void of contextual response of the current external stimulus. It involves living in the moment allowing us the freedom to act without hesitation and with the absence of intrusion. The performative state is a feedback loop of performance/response inside the same moment and action.
